Firebase 
    Firebase is a set of backend cloud computing services and application development platforms provided by Google. 
    It hosts databases, services, authentication, and integration for a variety of application.
    It's a tool made by Google; a Google app development platform. 
    Firebase is not a programming language or framework.
    It’s a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) - a platform with tools to handle backend features like auth, database, storage, and hosting without writing your own backend code.
    A toolbox from Google that gives you ready-made backend services (like login, database, and hosting) so you don’t have to build them yourself.
    However, if i want to build all that myself, I'd have to use a backend language (like Python with Flask or Django) and set up:
        My own authentication system
        My own database (like PostgreSQL)
        My own file storage
        My own server and hosting
    Firebase supports:
        Authentication
        Cloud Functions
        Cloud Storage
        Cloud Messaging
        Database
        Hosting 
        Security
        Crashlytics
        Performance Monitoring
        Test Labs etc..

Set Up Firebase in React-Vite
    1. Install Firebase SDK
        npm install firebase
    2. Set Up Firebase Project (from Firebase Console)
        Go to Firebase Console
        Click “Add project”
        Follow the steps
        After creation, click “Web” (</>) to register app
        You'll get Firebase config – copy it.
    3. In React-Vite app, create firebase.js
        src/firebase.js
    4. Paste the copied configuration.
    5. Add .env for Security (Optional)
        VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=xxxx
        VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=xxxx ...

        Update firebase.js to use env
            const firebaseConfig = {
                apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
                authDomain: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
                ...
                };
    6. Use firebase in the app.
        import { db } from './firebase';
        // Use db with Firestore methods
    7. Run the App
        npm run dev
