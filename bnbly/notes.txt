Firebase 
    Firebase is a set of backend cloud computing services and application development platforms provided by Google. 
    It hosts databases, services, authentication, and integration for a variety of application.
    It's a tool made by Google; a Google app development platform. 
    Firebase is not a programming language or framework.
    It’s a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) - a platform with tools to handle backend features like auth, database, storage, and hosting without writing your own backend code.
    A toolbox from Google that gives you ready-made backend services (like login, database, and hosting) so you don’t have to build them yourself.
    However, if i want to build all that myself, I'd have to use a backend language (like Python with Flask or Django) and set up:
        My own authentication system
        My own database (like PostgreSQL)
        My own file storage
        My own server and hosting
    Firebase supports:
        Authentication
        Cloud Functions
        Cloud Storage
        Cloud Messaging
        Database
        Hosting 
        Security
        Crashlytics
        Performance Monitoring
        Test Labs etc..

Set Up Firebase in React-Vite
    1. Install Firebase SDK
        npm install firebase
    2. Set Up Firebase Project (from Firebase Console)
        Go to Firebase Console
        Click “Add project”
        Follow the steps
        After creation, click “Web” (</>) to register app
        You'll get Firebase config – copy it.
    3. In React-Vite app, create firebase.js
        src/firebase.js
    4. Paste the copied configuration.
    5. Add .env for Security (Optional)
        VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=xxxx
        VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=xxxx ...

        Update firebase.js to use env
            const firebaseConfig = {
                apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
                authDomain: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
                ...
                };
    6. Use firebase in the app.
        import { db } from './firebase';
        // Use db with Firestore methods
    7. Run the App
        npm run dev


Users Authentication Set up
    Step-by-Step Firebase Auth Setup (Email & Password)
    1. Enable Firebase Auth in Console
        Go to Firebase Console
        Choose project (bnbly)
        Go to Build > Authentication > Sign-in Method
        Enable Email/Password provider.
    2. Add auth to firebase.js file
        import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';
        const auth = getAuth(app);
        export { auth };
    3.  Create Sign Up & Login Pages with appropraite functions using useState where needed.
            Signup.jsx - createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
            Login.jsx - signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
    4. Create Routes for login and signup in App.jsx
            import { useState } from 'react';
            import { auth } from '../firebase/firebaseConfig';
            import { createUserWithEmailAndPassword } from 'firebase/auth';

            const Signup = () => {
                const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
                const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
                const [error, setError] = useState('');

                const handleSignup = async (e) => {
                    e.preventDefault();
                    try {
                    await createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
                    alert('Signup successful!');
                    } catch (err) {
                    setError(err.message);
                    }
                };
                return (
                    <div className="flex justify-center items-center min-h-screen bg-gray-100">
                    <form onSubmit={handleSignup} className="bg-white p-8 rounded shadow-md w-80">
                        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Sign Up</h2>
                        {error && <p className="text-red-500">{error}</p>}
                        <input className="w-full p-2 mb-2 border rounded" type="email" placeholder="Email" onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)} />
                        <input  className="w-full p-2 mb-2 border rounded" type="password" placeholder="Password" onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)} />
                        <button className="w-full bg-blue-500 text-white p-2 rounded hover:bg-blue-600"> Sign Up </button>
                    </form>
                    </div>
                );
            };
            export default Signup;

onAuthStateChanged is Firebase’s built-in listener that watches the authentication status of the user in real time.
    What it does
    It runs a callback every time the user’s sign-in state changes.
    onAuthStateChanged listens for login/logout changes and runs the app code when the user signs in, signs out, or reloads the page, so the UI always matches the current auth state.
    onAuthStateChanged can be thought of like a security guard at the door of an app.
        Whenever someone enters (logs in) or leaves (logs out), the guard immediately tells who’s inside.
        It keeps watching, even if the page reloads, so we always know if a user is logged in or not.
    We think of it like turning off the TV when we leave the room, otherwise, it keeps running even if we’re not watching.
    
    Possible triggers:
        User logs in 
        User logs out 
        Page refresh (it restores the session if the user was already signed in)
        Firebase finishes loading initial auth state

    Why it’s important
        Without onAuthStateChanged, the app wouldn’t know whether the user is:
        Already logged in when they reload the page
        Just signed out from another tab
        Or signed in from a different device
        It basically keeps the UI in sync with Firebase Auth in real time.

    How it works:
        We reload the page ? onAuthStateChanged immediately checks if there’s a logged-in user from Firebase’s memory.
        If the user logs in or logs out, the state updates instantly.
        No need to manually check every time. It’s like automatic login detection.
    The stopAuthListener variable is just a clean-up function that Firebase gives us.
        Here’s why it’s there: When we call: onAuthStateChanged(auth, callback)
        Firebase starts listening in the background for changes in the login state.
        If we leave the page or unmount the component, we should stop listening, otherwise, it keeps running, wastes memory, and might cause bugs.
        Firebase returns a function that stops the listener, we store it in unsubscribe so we can call it later inside:
        return () => stopAuthListener();
    It’s specifically for tracking Firebase Authentication state changes. It only works for users who are signed in through Firebase Auth.
